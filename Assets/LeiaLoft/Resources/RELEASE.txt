RELEASE NOTES
=============

Product: Leia Unity Plugin

Version: 0.6.17
   Date: 10 February 2021

OVERVIEW
========

This package provides a LeiaCamera component that should be added
to existing Unity camera. LeiaDisplay component also appears when
LeiaCamera is added. The LeiaDisplay contains settings that define
render mode in general, while LeiaCamera controls specific view
parameters.

KNOWN ISSUES and GENERAL WARNINGS
=================================

Many known issues with Unity are specific to a non-LTS version of Unity. We recommend only building from supported LTS versions of Unity.
    Please see the "UNITY VERSION SUPPORT" section for more information on supported LTS versions.

2020-11-09
    Attempting to use the LeiaMediaRecorder on a Windows dev machine, with build target's graphics API set to a member of the OpenGL family (Core, ES 3), on Unity
        versions 2018.3 - 2018.4 may result in recorded pixels being vertically squashed. Workaround is to set graphics API to the D3D family or upgrade to
        Unity 2019.x. Issue replicated on Unity 2018.3.14, 2018.4.23, 2018.4.24. Issue confirmed to not occur on Unity 2017.4.34, Unity 2019.1.0.

2020-11-05
    Builds from Unity 2019.2 to Android may switch between LightfieldMode On and LightfieldMode Off multiple times as the Android status bar is dismissed.
    If the device switches between LightfieldMode On and LightfieldMode Off multiple times, the device's backlight may remain on after the app closes.
    Issue replicated in builds from Unity 2019.2.01, 2019.2.05. Issue confirmed resolved in builds from Unity 2019.02.14, Unity 2019.04.06.

2020-09-24
    Builds from Unity 2018.3 to Android which call Applicaiton.Quit will not engage the Leia device's backlight when the app is re-opened.
    This is due to a known bug in Unity which was resolved in Unity 2018.4.6. Issue replicated in Unity 2018.3.14.
    Workaround is to build with Unity 2018.4.6+.

2020-09-17
    When building from Unity 2018.3.* to the Lumepad or Hydrogen, closing an app using Application.Quit then re-opening the app from the device's "Recents"
        tab may trigger an issue where artifacts like LeiaLoft firmware DisplaySDK aar 7.1 (md5 f15b1320...) fail to be reloaded. As a result the the
        device will be unable to show 3D lit content. This is a known Unity bug. Issue confirmed on Unity 2018.3.14.
        Issue confirmed to not exist on earlier version Unity 2018.2.2 or later version Unity 2018.4.26
    Workaround: use Unity 2018.4.6+ https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/2018.4.6 see "Fixes"

2020-08-19
    Added bool ParallaxAutoRotationAnimation property to the LeiaDisplay. When apps play in a fixed orientation, devs can now change at runtime
        whether a LeiaDisplay rotates parallax cues. Previously users could only change this value using the LeiaDisplay inspector in the Unity editor.

2020-08-11
    Builds to Android from Unity 2019.1.x with Vulkan graphics API and video content in the scene, may crash on scene load with an error like
    OMX-VDEC-1080P: Unsupported output color format for c2d (2141391876)
    OMX-VDEC-1080P: Setting color format failed
    Workaround is to set your Android graphics API to a target other than Vulkan, or update your Unity editor version.
    (Player settings -> Player -> Android settings -> Other settings -> (x) Auto graphics API -> move Vulkan to lower priority)

2020-08-07
    Builds from Unity 2019.1 to Android which use the Android onscreen back button to trigger an app close will not engage the Leia
        device's backlight when the app is re-opened.
    This is due to a known bug in Unity which was resolved in Unity 2019.2.2. Issue replicated in Unity 2019.1.6, 2019.1.14, 2019.2.1.
    Workaround is to build with Unity 2018.4- or 2019.2.2+.

2020-08-07
    Unity may sometimes deload the shaders that the LeiaLoft Unity SDK needs in order to function. Unity will throw an exception like
        ArgumentNullException: Value cannot be null.
        Parameter name: shader
        ... (at Assets/LeiaLoft/Scripts/Internal/LeiaState/AbstractLeiaStateTemplate.cs:77)
        NullReferenceException: ...
        LeiaLoft.AbstractLeiaStateTemplate.GetEmissionX ...
    Solution is to reimport the assets (Unity > Assets menu > Reimport all)

2020-07_30
    If user generates tuned content for an Android build / installed Android APK using the LeiaConfigAdjustmentsUI, then rebuilds or
        reinstalls their APK, their tuning file from previous tuning will affect current output. Users are recommended to tune
        content in the UnityEditor, rather than in an installed APK.

WHAT'S NEW
==========

0.6.17

2021_02_09
    Resolved an issue where setting multiple types of LeiaMedia video content (clip + URL) could introduce conflicts on the VideoPlayer.

2021_02_3
    Removed video files:
     - Source/Assets/LeiaLoft/Modules/LeiaMedia/Example/Videos/exampleVideo_2x2.mp4 and
     - Source/Assets/LeiaLoft/Modules/LeiaMedia/Example/Videos/recording_2x2.mp4
    From the SDK in favor of DandelionsSnipOgvVP81440_2x2.ogv

2021_01_27
    Fixed a bug with LeiaMediaViewer which was causing col and row counts to stick to their initial value rather than changing as user updated LeiaMedia.
        LeiaMedia col and row values now update as
            - user changes media in inspector (if new media has a name and is parsable), or
            - user sets values by script and supplies cols, rows as arguments, or
            - user specifies LeiaMediaViewer.ActiveLeiaMediaRows and LeiaMediaViewer.ActiveLeiaMediaCols

2021_01_26
    Resolved an issue where changing RenderTechnique (Stereo / Default) could update content without updating LeiaDisplay's inspector.

2021_01_25
    Fixed a bug with *LeiaStateTemplate where using Ctrl-L menu to reset DisplayConfig would cause refs to ViewCount variables to be dropped.

2021_01_25
    Fixed a bug with *LeiaStateTemplate where setting camera view count, would cause interlacing steps to be performed with default shader values.
        
2021_01_20
    Resolved an issue appearing in some versions of Unity where setting LeiaDisplay Editor Emulated Device to a landscape config might cause content to be stretched.

2021_01_12
    Resolved an issue where 4 LeiaViews sould spawn regardless of device configuration then be destroyed once firmware data was pulled

2021_1_5
    Streamlined About window UX, adding welome screen, consolidating release notes and log settings to one location. Added auto popup functionality.

2020_12_28
    When LeiaPostEffectsController copies a MonoBehaviour from a root Camera to a LeiaView Camera, it will now set any LeiaView refs, to the LeiaView of that LeiaView's Camera.
    Modified LeiaPostEffectsController to copy Leia effects to a LeiaView, not a GameObject.

2020_12_23
    Resolved an issue where the LeiaPostEffectsController would sometimes cause errors regarding calls to Application.isPlaying in constructor.

0.6.16

2020_12_10
    Added stereo render technique

2020_12_01
    Implemented DisplayConfig :: ToString. This will provide some debug data to users. Do not rely upon parsing this string; implement a class conversion operator instead.

PREVIOUSLY

0.6.15

2020_11_06
    Resolved an issue where closing the DisplayConfig tuner (Ctrl-L menu) would sometimes cause interlacing to switch to a 2D style.

2020_11_3
    Added API overloads for loading Leia Media with custom rows and columns

0.6.14

2020_11_05
    Added Resolution Scale to LeiaConfigSettingsUI.

2020_10_08
    Resolved an issue with Unity's Post-Processing Stack Version 2.3 that caused PostProcessingLayers to add redundant CommandBuffers to LeiaViews and
        unnecessarily remove CommandBuffers from the root Camera. This affected all Unity SDK versions up to 0.6.14.
        
    Resolved an issue where convergence plane Editor UI was always drawn for a 2560 x 1440 aspect ratio (1.7777).

2020_10_06
    Resolved an issue with calculating the LeiaDevice's portrait or landscape orientaiton and passing that info to DisplayConfig in Unity Editor versions 2017.4 - 2019.3
        would cause content to be stretched.

2020_10_06
    Resolved issue in Parallax Effect module where gyro would not disable when application is not in focus, draining battery unnecessarily.
    
2020_10_02
    Deprecated LeiaCamera.ClearCommandBuffers. Users should no longer expect the LeiaLoft Unity SDK to automatically clear, release, or remove any of their
        CommandBuffers. (Users will still have to reattach their CommandBuffers when LeiaViews are reconstructed.)

2020_09_29
    Added support for AndroidLeiaDevice :: SetDisplayLightBalance. Call with param in range 0 - 1. This modulates the intensity of the Android device's backlight.
    
2020_09_18
    Moved assets in LeiaLoft/Examples/LeiaLogo/Resources to .../LeiaLogo/LeiaLogoData. This excludes the assets from the AssetDatabase by default, which
        saves 0.4 MB in APKs which do not include the "LeiaLogo" scene in their build.

2020_09_18
    LeiaViews now take the same renderingPath as was root camera had. Previously, LeiaViews would always use project default renderingPath.

2020_09_15
    Changed labeling of LeiaDisplay :: RenderModes. RenderModes HPO and 2D are legacy terms; we now think in terms of whether the device's display is in
        LightfieldMode: On or LighfieldMode: Off.
    Users should change references to LeiaDisplay.Instance.DesiredLeiaStateID = {"HPO"/"2D"} to LeiaDisplay.Instance.DesiredLightfieldMode = LeiaDisplay.LightfieldMode.On/Off

2020_09_14
    Added a drop-down menu for selecting an emulated device in editor.

2020_09_08
    Resolved a Unity Editor 2018.3+ issue with LeiaLoft Unity SDK 0.6.13 where changing the LeiaDisplay's RenderMode would cause content to be stretched.
    
2020_09_04
    Resolved an issue where LeiaMediaRecorder would record views in row-swapped order (wanted 0123, previously got 2301).

2020_09_03
    Re-enabled alpha blending. This feature had been supported in SDK 0.5.0 (Jan 2019), disabled in SDK 0.6.13 (August 2020) and is now re-enabled.
        Users who previously had a LeiaDisplay :: Enable Alpha Blending setting in a scene made with LeiaLoft Unity SDK 0.5.0  will need to re-set the
        LeiaDisplay :: Enable Alpha Blending flag in each scene.

2020_09_03
    Resolved an issue where display would show views in order 0123 but LeiaMediaView would show content from 3012 in corresponding views.

2020_08_18
    Changed calling style for LeiaCameraUtils.ScreenPointToRay. Users should now supply a LeiaCamera and screen-space Vector3.

0.6.13

2020_07_30
    Added support for generating user-tuned parameters in the UnityEditor using the LeiaConfigAdjustmentsUI, which can be shipped in APKs.

2020_07_20
    Introduced an IFaceTrackingDisplay interface. LeiaDisplay fulfills this interface, allowing it to perform view peeling and field-of-view shifting.

2020_07_17
	Added stub API for eventual support for Android devices to load additional DisplayConfig info from within their virtual file system.

2020_07_01
    Resolved an issue where users could accidentally update params on the wrong DisplayConfig. Correct DisplayConfig will now be
        default DisplayConfig which is modified, users will be warned if their DisplayConfig is null, and users will be warned if they
        attempt to modify a DisplayConfig other than the default DisplayConfig.

2020-05-12
  Resolved an issue where retrieving LeiaDisplay.Instance during edit time would cause more LeiaDisplays to spawn.
        Now retrieving LeiaDisplay.Instance during edit mode returns null.
        
	Added EditorWindowUtil for reusable editor window functions

2020-05-01	
    Adjusted color settings to accomodate ACT/view sharpening on linear color space.

2020-04-28
  Added release and debug gradle minification to Recommended Settings Window. Any setting beside None will cause backlight failure on Android.

2020-04-24
    Resolved an issue where selecting LeiaCamera might dirty scene in some versions of Unity (2019?).

2020-04-23
    Redesigned DisplayConfig saving with json to support Android.

2020-04-22
    Resolved an issue where GPU memory would continue to be reserved for nonexistent textures.

2020-04-13
    Added step to clone tags from root camera to LeiaRenderCamera. This may change behavior for users who use Camera.main.
    Enabled support for multi-LeiaCamera-editing. This support may be changed in the future.
    Added support for iterating through LeiaViews in a LeiaCamera. Note that LeiaViews may sometimes be null (e.g. on frame 0).

2020-04-13
    Resolved an issue where converting between orthographic camera and perspective camera would not change interlacing state.
    Added a method, LeiaDisplay.ForceLeiaStateUpdate(), for forcing a regeneration of interlacing state without changing backlight.
        This method resolves a specific issue with orthographic / perspective cameras and does not need to be used by external users.

2020-04-08
    Modified LeiaDisplay's StateChanged delegate to only trigger once per state change.
        Users who wrote code that reacted to changes in backlight state, or LeiaDisplay's
        StateChanged callback, should test if behavior changed for them.
    Reduced the number of calls sent to backlight service per DesiredLeiaState change.
        Previously 4+ backlight calls would occur each time the interlacing or backlight mode changed.

2020-04-07
    Added accessor variables for LeiaView's Camera, absolute ID, x position in camera grid, y position in camera grid.

2020-04-03
    Resolved an issue with state tracking when Android status bar would be pulled down.

2020-04-01
    Rolled back Display aar to 6.x.x. This resolves an issue where users who pulled down the Android status bar would see parallax content.

2020-03-31
    Updated Post Processing Stack Camera Reset url

2020-03-30
    Removed checks for ViewSharpening on LeiaDisplay; users will still be warned to remove ViewSharpening because class is deprecated.

2020-03-30
    Resolved an issue where orthographic content would be stretched in 2D mode.

2020-03-24
    Restored the ParallaxEffects module to LeiaLoft modules.

2020-03-24
    Resolved an issue where parallax auto rotation setting would not remain set.

2020-03-20
    Extended PPSv2 compatibility back from 2019.1+ to 2018.1+.

2020-03-19
    Resolved one issue where users would exit app but backlight would remain on.

2020-03-18
    Resolved a bug where users would encounter a bug when changing LeiaDisplay renderMode in edit mode.

2020-03-16
    Resolved an issue where tabbing out, then back in, would draw a black screen when trying to build to standalone targets.

2020-03-13
    Added flags for some build-breaking errors.

2020-03-13:
    Resolved a bug where backlight would not turn off, or would turn off slowly, after a scene switch.

2020-03-11
    Resolved an issue where only 4 LeiaViews would show as camera gizmos in editor scene view.

2020-02-10
    Deprecated LeiaDisplay :: AlphaBlending interlaced content.

2020-02-10
    Added PreBuildProcess macro for setting settings before build. Enabled wildcard searches in post-build macro.

2020-02-07
    Patched issues with 2D/HPO switching that appeared ~Jan 7, AKA SDK 0.6.7.
    Removed support for HDR on interlacing camera, as it was preventing blits to screen in HDRP.
    Individual LeiaViews still support HDR when root camera has HDR enabled.

2020-01-17
    Changed scripting API for setting LeiaMedia content on LeiaMediaViewer.
    When writing C# scripts, instead of assigning LeiaMedia public variables
    LeiaMediaVideoURL, leiaMediaVideoClip, leiaMediaTexture,
        set them from script using
    SetVideoURL, SetVideoClip, SetTexture

2020-01-20
    Changed LeiaView.AttachCommandBufferToView API. Users should now specify CameraEvent.

2019-12-01
    Added LeiaMediaViewer - a gameObject which can display prerendered n-view content including textures and movies.

0.5.0
